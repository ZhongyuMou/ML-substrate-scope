# ML-substrate-scope
This repository serves as the Supporting Information for [paper place holder](http://), and as a reference for researchers who aim to predict enzyme substrate scope using machine learning.
## Table of Content
* Machine learning script
* Liquid robots scripts
* Rosetta modeling input example
* Nitrilase top models
* Nitrile coordinates

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python version: 3.7
* [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) version: 0.22
* [Imbalanced-learn](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/) version: 0.6
* Pandas version: 1.0
* Numpy version: 1.17
* Matplotlib version: 3.1

## Usage
The instructions of using machine learning as well as an example of our nitrilase project is documented at: [machine_learning_script_notebook.ipynb](https://github.com/ZhongyuMou/ML-substrate-scope/blob/master/machine_learning_script_notebook.ipynb "machine_learning_script_notebook.ipynb")
Features (or descriptors) as well as the machine learning model can be swapped by other programs.
